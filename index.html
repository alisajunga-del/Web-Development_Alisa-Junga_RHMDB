       <h2>Claude Monet Biography</h2>
       <p> Recognized as the 'Father of Impressionism', Claude Monet (1840 - 1926) instigated one of the most important artistic movements in history, and his groundbreaking work continues to inspire the development of artists and artistic styles today.

How do artists represent and reflect the world they live in? The fact that the natural world is constantly changing makes depicting it a challenge when it comes to oil paintings, which are static and cannot show motion like movies do. To address this issue, the painter Claude Monet became one of the founders of the Impressionism art movement. Impressionism broke from convention and showed artists a new way to develop techniques to get to the heart of the reality in front of them.
Claude Monet was born in Paris, France on November 14, 1840. He began drawing as a boy when his family moved to Normandy. After becoming known for making caricatures of his teachers and people living in town, Monet met landscape artist Eugene Bodin, who taught him how to paint outside.
This led to Monet moving back to Paris, where he became a student at the Academie Suisse. Here, he immersed himself in the Barbizon school, which emphasized making preliminary sketches outside and then bringing the canvas back indoors to paint the natural world in a controlled environment.
Monet wasn't satisfied with this approach and began to paint outside, remaining on the scene from the beginning until the end instead of finishing the work inside of a studio. He was beginning to focus on capturing the evanescence of shifting, natural light, which required faster painting and a new attitude about art. Impressionism actually became possible thanks to manufacturers producing new ranges of paint color in tubes that were easy to transport and use outside rather than having to rely on a studio to mix and store the hues.

<h3>Claude Monet Paintings</h3>
     <p> Most well-known today for his series of serene water lilies paintings, 19th-century Impressionist Claude Monet was a groundbreaking tour de force in the development of expressive art. Throughout his long life, which spanned the years between 1840 and 1926, Monet would progress from drawing amusing caricatures of friends to capturing the elusive nuances of natural scenes in various attitudes of light and color. Along with the other Impressionists, Monet's aim in his painting was to capture reality and analyse the ever-changing nature of light and color. He recorded his surrounding faithfully, from the grime of a Paris railway station to the incandescent beauty of his later paintings based on the gardens he created at Giverny in north-eastern France. Frequently exhibited and successful during his lifetime, Monet's fame and popularity soared in the second half of the 20th century when he became one of the world's most famous painters and a source of inspiration for burgeoning groups of artists. By striving to translate his unique perception of the natural world directly to the canvas, Claude Monet was instrumental in forging an entirely new direction for the world of art.

    <h4>Painting "San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk, 1908 by Claude Monet"</h4>

<p> San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk is an oil painting by Claude Monet that was painted in 1908. The painting is owned by National Museum Cardiff, the national art gallery of Wales. The original painting is oil on canvas and the dimension is 65.2cm x 92.4cm (25.7 in x 36.4 in).
The term impression signifies the sensory information registered on the retina prior to any recognition of the object. For example, the eye sees tiny black spots before it recognizes them as faraway pedestrians. When you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have before you, a tree, a house, a field or whatever Monet explained to a neighbor in Giverny, merely think here is a little square of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yellow, and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact color and shape, until it gives you your own na√Øve impression of the scene before you.
Monet later claimed that he wished he might share the experience of a blind person suddenly granted the power of sight.
San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk is a prime example of Claude Monet. Also occasionally referred to as Sunset in Venice, was painted in the autumn of 1908 in Venice where Monet and his wife Alice had traveled by their own chauffeur-driven car. They stayed first at the Palazzo Barbaro and later at the Hotel Brittania. It was here that he created this masterpiece.
The period in which Monet created this riverscape or seascape painting was when he began losing his eyesight from gray cataracts. Much like other impressionists who were afflicted with pain or disease, suffering seemed to provoke them to do their greatest works: Vincent van Gogh created his magnum opus Starry Night while tormented by his psychological breakdown, Monet painted this masterpiece. The vibrant blue, yellow, and red colors were used by Monet to depict the sunset. Across the lagoon we see Venice, a famous island church in Venice, Italy. </p>
<h4>"These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession. This is beyond the strength of an old man, and yet I want to express what I feel. I have destroyed some of the canvases. I begin once again. ... I hope something will come of all this effort."</h4>
